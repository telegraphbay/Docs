# Data Freshness

In Telegraph Bay, the freshness of data can vary across different tables due to variations in the frequency of the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. This means that different tables may have different update frequencies and latency periods before the latest data is available for analysis.

To provide users with transparency and empower them to make data-driven decisions, Telegraph Bay incorporates a convenient feature. By hovering over the green tick icon located on the bottom-left corner of each chart, users can quickly check the timestamp of the latest data pull. This allows users to stay informed about the recency of the data they are analyzing and take into account any potential time lags.

It is important to note that the data pull times are indicative of the most recent updates available for analysis. However, it is always recommended to consider the context of data collection and processing timelines when interpreting the insights derived from the charts.

By providing visibility into data freshness, Telegraph Bay ensures that users have the necessary information to assess the timeliness and reliability of the data they are working with. This feature enhances the overall user experience and enables users to make informed decisions based on the most up-to-date information available.
