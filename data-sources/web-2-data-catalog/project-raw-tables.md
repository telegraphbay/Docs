# Project Raw Tables

In addition to the standardized schema design, Telegraph Bay offers a unique feature which allows project to integrate additional data sources for custom analysis use cases.&#x20;

Under the "Custom Tables" section within their project folders, project teams can access the raw data in its original format. This data may come from various sources, such as platform backend databases, custom data feeds, or other data integration mechanisms. By having direct access to the raw data, project teams can explore, manipulate, and analyze it according to their specific needs and use cases.
